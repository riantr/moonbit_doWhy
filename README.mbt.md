# moonbit_dowhy

A MoonBit port of [DoWhy 0.14](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy) (PyWhy) -- causal
graph construction, effect identification, effect estimation and refutation, with
**zero external runtime dependencies**.

[![CI](https://github.com/riantr/moonbit_doWhy/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/riantr/moonbit_doWhy/actions/workflows/check.yml)
[![MoonBit](https://mooncakes.io/assets/badge/riantr/moonbit_dowhy-v0.0.2.svg)](https://mooncakes.io/riantr/moonbit_dowhy)

The package ships as `riantr/moonbit_dowhy` and runs on `native`, `wasm`,
`wasm-gc` and `js`. The test suite executes on all four.

## Status

| Area | Upstream | This port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Causal graph, d-separation | `dowhy.graph`, `dowhy.causal_graph` | ported |
| Identification | `dowhy.causal_identifier` | ported (backdoor, frontdoor, general adjustment, IV, mediation) |
| Estimation | `dowhy.causal_estimators` | ported (linear regression, propensity score weighting / matching / stratification, doubly robust, instrumental variable, two stage, regression discontinuity) |
| Refutation | `dowhy.causal_refuters` | ported (bootstrap, placebo treatment, data subset, dummy outcome, random common cause, unobserved common cause) |
| Synthetic data | `dowhy.datasets` | ported (`linear_dataset` and the fixtures the upstream tests use) |
| Causal discovery | `dowhy.graph_learners` | ported (the PC algorithm with the Fisher-z test of conditional independence) |
| Causal discovery | `dowhy.graph_learners` (GES, CDT, LiNGAM) | **not ported** -- upstream delegates those to `causal-learn` / `cdt` / `lingam`, which this dependency-free port does not wrap |
| Graphical causal models | `dowhy.gcm` | **not ported** -- upstream depends on AutoGluon, CatBoost and symbolic-equation fitting |
| Causal prediction | `dowhy.causal_prediction` | **not ported** -- upstream depends on PyTorch |

Everything that is listed as ported is covered by tests that compare against
the numbers the upstream implementation produces. The three rows marked *not
ported* are stated plainly rather than approximated: a wrong answer is worse
than a missing one.

## Install

```shell
moon add riantr/moonbit_dowhy
```

## Quick start

```moonbit
import "riantr/moonbit_dowhy"
import "riantr/moonbit_dowhy/datasets"

/// Build a confounded data set: `W0 -> v0`, `W0 -> y`, `v0 -> y`.
let dataset = @datasets.linear_dataset(
  42,
  1000,
  @datasets.LinearConfig::confounded(),
)

/// Build the model. The graph is derived from the semantic roles of the
/// variables when no explicit graph is given.
let model = @moonbit_dowhy.CausalModel::new(
  dataset.frame(),
  dataset.treatments(),
  [dataset.outcome()],
  None,
  dataset.common_causes(),
  dataset.instruments(),
  dataset.effect_modifiers(),
  dataset.frontdoor_variables(),
)

/// Identify the effect with the backdoor criterion.
let estimand = model.identify_effect("backdoor")

/// Estimate the average treatment effect.
let estimate = model.estimate_effect(
  "backdoor.linear_regression",
  1.0,
  0.0,
  "ate",
  [],
)

println("ATE: " + estimate.estimate().to_string())
println("95% CI: [" + estimate.confidence_interval_lower().to_string() +
  ", " + estimate.confidence_interval_upper().to_string() + "]")
```

A runnable version of this snippet lives in [`examples/quick_start.mbt`](examples/quick_start.mbt).

## Package layout

| Package | Import path | Ports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/api` | the subset of `pandas.DataFrame` the estimators use |
| `utils` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/utils` | matrices, least squares, distributions, descriptive statistics, a deterministic generator |
| `graph` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/graph` | `dowhy.graph`, `dowhy.causal_graph` |
| `identifiers` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/identifiers` | `dowhy.causal_identifier` |
| `model` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/model` | `dowhy.causal_model`, `dowhy.causal_estimator` (the estimate objects) |
| `estimators` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/estimators` | `dowhy.causal_estimators` |
| `refuters` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/refuters` | `dowhy.causal_refuters` |
| `datasets` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/datasets` | `dowhy.datasets` and the deterministic test fixtures |
| `cm` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/cm` | the PC causal discovery algorithm and the Fisher-z independence test |
| `tests` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/tests` | the cross-package integration tests |
| `examples` | `riantr/moonbit_dowhy/examples` | the runnable quick start |

The root package `riantr/moonbit_dowhy` holds `CausalModel`, the entry point
that ties the data, the graph and the estimators together.

## Numerical conventions

The port reproduces the numbers of DoWhy, so the conventions of NumPy, pandas,
statsmodels and scikit-learn are deliberate rather than accidental:

- `variance` uses `ddof = 0` unless another degree of freedom is asked for;
  `cov` uses `ddof = 1`, like `numpy.cov`.
- `percentile` uses the linear interpolation of NumPy.
- `average_rank` reproduces `pandas.Series.rank(ascending=True)`, so ties get
  the mean rank -- the propensity score stratification estimator depends on it.
- `round_half_even` reproduces `numpy.round` and `pandas.Series.round(0)`.
- A rank deficient design is solved with the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse,
  the minimum norm solution, like `statsmodels.OLS`, which uses `pinv`.
- The residual variance uses `df_resid = n - rank`.
- The logistic regression minimises `sum_i log_loss(y_i, p_i) + 1/(2C) ||w||^2`,
  the convention of `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` with its default
  `penalty="l2"` and `C=1.0`.

## Deliberate differences from upstream

Three behaviours differ on purpose, and each one is a case where the upstream
code is order-dependent rather than wrong in an absolute sense:

- The backdoor identifier enumerates its candidate adjustment variables in
  sorted order. Upstream iterates over a Python `set`, so its order depends
  on the hash seed; the sets it returns are the same.
- The frontdoor identifier returns the **smallest** valid set. Upstream breaks
  out of its loop after the first match it finds and therefore returns the
  largest one.
- The efficient backdoor criterion (the Smucler-Sapienza-Rotnitzky min-cut)
  is not implemented. It returns an empty adjustment set together with a
  message that says so, instead of returning a wrong one.

## Development

The gate that a release has to pass:

```shell
moon check --deny-warn     # a warning is a failure
moon test --deny-warn
moon fmt --check
typos
```

The cross-package tests live in `src/tests/` rather than inside the
implementation packages, so that a published package never carries a test-only
dependency on `datasets`.

The Python helpers under `_verify/` are the tooling that produced the upstream
reference numbers the tests are compared against.
